# FTC Robotics 2025

Overview

This repository contains the FTC robot control software for my Robotics Team for the 2025-2026 season.
It supports TeleOp driving, intake, flywheel shooter, ring pusher servo, climber, and multiple autonomous routines for competition.

The project is written using the FTC SDK and is compatible with Android Studio and REV Control Hub + Expansion Hub hardware.

# Hardware Requirements
Control System

REV Control Hub

REV Expansion Hub (connected via RS485)

Motors

- GoBILDA 5202/3/4 Series DC Motors (with encoders)

  4× drivetrain (mecanum)

1× intake

2× shooter (left shooter uses encoder)

1× climb

Servo

1× Standard positional servo

Ring pusher / holder

OpModes Included
TeleOp

SWYFT_Ri3d
Full driver-controlled mode with mecanum drive, intake, shooter, servo, and climb.

Autonomous

SWYFT Auto Long Blue

SWYFT Auto Long Red

SWYFT Auto Short

All autonomous routines are time-based and open-loop (no encoders for driving).

Driver Controls (TeleOp)
🚗 Driving (Mecanum)

Left Stick X → Strafe left/right

Left Stick Y → Forward/back

Right Stick Y → Forward/back (adds with left stick Y)

Right Stick X → Rotate robot

🍴 Intake + Ring Pusher

X Button → Intake IN + servo to 0.5 (load position)

Right Trigger → Intake IN (servo unchanged)

Left Trigger → Intake OUT

No input → Intake OFF

Servo defaults to 0.7 when not pressing X

🎯 Shooter (Flywheels)

A Button → Toggle shooter ON/OFF

Shooter uses bang-bang velocity control

Target velocity ≈ 1500 ticks/sec

🧗 Climb

D-Pad Up → Climb UP

D-Pad Down → Climb DOWN

Neutral → Climb OFF

Shooter Control Notes

ShooterL is configured as DcMotorEx and uses encoder velocity.

Bang-bang control alternates between:

Full power (spin-up)

Holding power (maintain RPM)

Shooter motors must be mounted with opposite directions set in code.

Autonomous Behavior Summary
Long Autos

Drive forward

Turn ~45°

Drive forward slightly

Run intake briefly

Shoot 3 rings

Short Auto

Small backward movement

Shoot 3 rings
